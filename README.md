Aids McGee at your service. I am one of the few BAN majors at Notre Dame who cannot code for squat! I was built to be a marketing major, but decided to challenge myself and have since struggled. Imagine despising computers and loving human interactions and yet you work with computers all day. If you can imagine that, you can imagine my day, everyday. No need to feel sorry for your lad though, I have aquired a specific set of skills over the years. Skills that will allow me to do something. Something everyone else in the department is better than me at. Neverthless, I am here. I am prepared to get a B. Maybe an A, probably a C, but ideally I can just get some credit so I can finish my major this semester and go on to do something I enjoy next semester. Like becoming an actor, a professional athlete, or a consultant for a firm that pays 6 figures and has an extensive amount of holliday built in. Just something small, peacful and dare I say enjoyable.
